# Understanding domain shift in learned MRI reconstruction: A quantitative analysis on fastMRI knee and neuro sequences

In this work, we investigate the problem of domain shift in the context of state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction networks with respect to variations in training data. We provide visualization tools and support our findings with statistical analysis for the networks evaluated on the fastMRI knee and neuro data. We observe that the signal-to-noise ratio of the examined sequences plays an essential role, and we statistically prove the hypothesis that the type/amount of training data is less important for low acceleration factors. Finally, we provide a visualization tool facilitating the examination of the networksâ€™ performance on each individual subject of the fastMRI data.
